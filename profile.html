        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
        look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
        page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and
          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
          not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
          the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
          <small>Aldus PageMaker</small> including versions of
          <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>.

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
            obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
            going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
            discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
            of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
            treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
            amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
            Lorem Ipsum
            <em
              >used since the <sup>1500s</sup> is reproduced below for those
              interested. Sections <sub>1.10.32</sub> and
              <sub>1.10.33</sub> from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero
              are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
              English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</em

            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing

            >"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
            dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
            will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
            pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a
            free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
            prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
            to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
            annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
            matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
            secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
            worse pains."</i
